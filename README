To download this repo for the first time use:
"git clone git@github.com:nburek/WidgetCore.git"
in the folder you want to download to. This will install the repository 
on your machine. 

To commit your changes back to the repository you must first use:
"git commit [filename] -m "Description of what you changed/added." or 
"git commit -a -m "Description of what you changed/added." to commit 
all the modified files. This will not add new files since git only 
checks against the list of known files.

After you have commited the changes you must push the files back to 
the repository by using:
"git push origin [branch name]"
You can make multiple commits before pushing out. This allows you to 
enter different messages for different files, based on what you changed.

To add a new file to the Repo use:
"git add [filename|folder]"
Then commit the change and push the files out. 

To create a new branch you need to use the following commands:
"git branch [new branch name]" this creates the new branch
"git checkout [new branch name]" this will change your working branch 
to the new branch.

To merge a branch1 into branch2 do:
"git checkout branch2" to change to work with branch2 then do
"git merge branch1" to merge branch1 into branch2. Then do a commit 
and push branch2 back to the origin.
